# Desktop

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Trumeet/Desktop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Trumeet/Desktop)

A simple Windows Secure Desktop demo written in Kotlin.

It is also a demo for Kotlin Native and Windows APIs.

Feel free to ask me questions in Issues and I'm sure I cannot answer them because this is my first Kotlin Native project, lol.
